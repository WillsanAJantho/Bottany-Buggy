# Main Component 
1. ESP 32
2. Soil Moisture sensor
3. Relay
4. Servo
5. DHT 11 Sensor
6. DC Motor
7. Transistor
8. Water Pump
9. Ultrasonic Mist actuator

# Working Mechanisms and Features
1. Automatic watering system: whenever the soil moisture of one of the plants is under the optimal value the robot will go to that plant and water it using the water pump.
2. Automatic Humidifier: Whenever the humidity drops below the optimal level, the ultrasonic mist actuator will activate to increase the air humidity in the plant's environment.
